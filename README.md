Arduino Uno

- 433Mhz RF Communication Transmitter
  - https://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-communication-Arduino-RF/
  - ESP8266, nRF24L01 and 433MHz module
  - In Europe, the 433MHz, 868MHz and 2.4MHz can be used with limited power
  - For the 433MHz, a transmitter may only transmit during 10% of the time
  - There are good transceiver modules for 433MHz and 2.4GHz. Google for "Sparkfun wireless buying guide" to see a nice list of possibilities. Or check the modules that are supported by the RadioHead library at airspayce.com/mikem.
